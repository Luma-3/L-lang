# L-lang

**L-lang** is a programming language project designed as a learning experience for creating a compiler. This project aims to explore the intricacies of language design and compiler development while welcoming feedback, contributions, and discussions from the community.

## Project Goals

- **Imperative Programming Language**: The language will follow an imperative programming style, inspired by languages like C and C++.
- **Compiler in C++20**: The compiler is being written in modern C++20, leveraging its features for robust and efficient code.
- **Combinatory Parser**: The project employs a combinatory parser, making the parsing modular and maintainable.
- **Code Generation with LLVM**: Machine code will be generated using the LLVM framework, offering flexibility and performance. Future iterations may experiment with a custom code generation model.

## Features (Planned)

- **Core Language Features**: Variables, functions, basic control flow (e.g., if, while, for), and other fundamental constructs.
- **Error Handling**: Clear and helpful error messages during both lexing and parsing.
- **Extensible Design**: The project is structured to allow for future expansions and feature additions.
- **Learning-Centric Development**: The primary focus is on learning, exploring, and improving.

## Current Status

The project is in the early stages of development. Contributions, critiques, and advice are greatly appreciated as the project evolves.
